Exploiting Bias in the Workplace
	- Reactance - telling people they can say no will more likely make them say yes
	- Reciprocity - Be the first to give (The feeling of obligation to give when you receive)
	- Door in the face - Forcing people to refuse a large request increases the likelihood of agreeing to a second, smaller request
	- Likeability - give compliments and build cooperation (Freely give honest flatter)
	- Social Proof-  People look to others to determine their own actions

Not Every Situation Requires Immediate Reaction
	- Take time to understand situation
	- Listen to their view before reacting
	- Don’t respond with a definitive standpoint too quickly
	- Know your audience
	- Ask others for their perspective
	- Compromise (Try to satisfy both parties, its fine to capitulate)
	- Listening / Treating people with respect
	- Take responsibility
	- Adjust your body language / tone of voice to suit the situation

Personality types
	- Understant each personality and how they work/think
	- Establish how to approach them
	- Adapt Accordingly

Respect Differences
	- Each has their own style and ethic
	- Be on the same team
It's your responsibility to make difficult relationships work.
