Hello, my name is Ben, I have a strong background in technology which has always fascinated me and was a major factor in my choice in degree subject. From this I got hands on experience with things like CAD/CAM, 3D printing and through my own curiosity developed my knowledge of python some cloud based computing. I feel that my interests have shifted more towards IT instead of engineering. Specifically, I chose DevOps to pursue because the ability to increase the efficiency at which organisations deliver applications and services interests me and I feel here that I can use my skills to make an impact.
