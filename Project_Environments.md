# Project Environments

## Objectives
- Understand the difference between BAU (business as usual) and Project work

- Have clear understanding of a project life cycle

## Project vs BAU
- BAU (normal things in the running of a company, day to day routine) - the normal execution of standard operations with an organisation
- Project (specific things which are happening in the company) - unique and transient with a desired outcome


## Optimisational strategy 

1. Initialisation - Start the project 
2. Plan - Plan what you are going to do
3. Execute - Execute the plan
4. Monitor - Monitor the progress
5. Closing

## DevOps

- DevOps doesnâ€™t necessarily need to know how to build product but know how to deploy it

- DevOps covers a lot of these areas as it is cross functional meaning bridges gap between development and operations automating the system 

- DevOps breaks down silos to work together share responsibilities and automate the development pipeline delivery faster time to market continuous release cycles and increased quality due to automated testing
